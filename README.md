# Binary Search Tree (BST) Project

This project implements a Binary Search Tree (BST) in JavaScript, providing a basic framework for performing various tree operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal. The implementation showcases the ability to maintain a balanced tree and offers utility functions for tree manipulation and visualization.

## Features

- **Tree Construction**: Build a binary search tree from an array of random values.
- **Tree Operations**: Perform basic tree operations like insertion, deletion, and finding minimum values.
- **Tree Traversal**: Support for various tree traversal methods including in-order, pre-order, post-order, and level-order.
- **Tree Balancing**: Check if the tree is balanced and rebalanced the tree if necessary.
- **Visualization**: Pretty print the tree structure to the console for easy visualization.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository and ensure you have Node.js installed on your system.
